# Data-Driven_Marketing_Strategy
Using data to derive insights into sales, consumer behavior, and marketing strategies

I analyzed data from CMS and conducted a marketing insight analysis for CL-Health

CL-Health is a healthcare staffing company providing staff (both contractual and permanent) to 
healthcare facilities.

# In this Analysis Report, I provided insights like:
- The current demand for employees across healthcare facilities and how it affects sales and revenue
- The influx of employee signups on CL-Health's app across the past year and months
- Identifying gaps in the market and providing recommendations to drive CL-Health's marketing

The database used for this project is from CMS (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services).
